The React Scroll To Top component is a reusable component that helps users navigate back to the top of a web page with a single click. It provides a smooth and convenient scrolling experience, enhancing the user interface and improving overall user experience.

This component is typically used in long-scrolling pages or applications where users may need to scroll down extensively. It eliminates the need for users to manually scroll back to the top by providing a prominent button or an overlay that appears when the user scrolls beyond a certain point on the page.

The React Scroll To Top component is easy to integrate into your React application. It can be implemented as a standalone component or incorporated into a higher-level layout component, such as the main layout or the router component.

Some key features of the React Scroll To Top component may include:

Customization: It allows you to customize the appearance and position of the scroll-to-top button to match the overall design of your application. You can customize the button's size, shape, color, and icon.
